## Decision-Ready Concept Brief — {repo\_list}

===========================================

**Placeholders:** Audience = **{audience}** · Constraints = **{constraints}** · Decision deadline = **{deadline}**

## Context

-------

Two complementary idea sources:

* **RPG\_TOOL** provides a repository planning graph approach with prompt templates for proposal-level feature selection, implementation-level DAGs, feature→interface mapping, and safe, scoped editing workflows; plus a feature/vector index schema for search. RPG\_TOOL\_codebase RPG\_TOOL\_codebase RPG\_TOOL\_codebase RPG\_TOOL\_codebase

* **DSPY-Tutorials** offers modular AI program patterns (agents, RAG, async/streaming, cache), observability via MLflow tracing/optimizer tracking, and optimizers like GEPA (reflective prompt evolution), with experimental RL tracks. DSPY-Tutorials\_codebase DSPY-Tutorials\_codebase DSPY-Tutorials\_codebase DSPY-Tutorials\_codebase

**Pain points:** ad-hoc feature planning, weak traceability from “what to build” to “what ran,” brittle prompting, and limited systematic optimization/measurement. Affected: PM/Leads (prioritization), Research/Eng (design→impl handoff), QA (coverage), DevOps (observability).

## Goals & Non-Goals

-------

## **Goals (testable)**

* Tie feature planning to executable interfaces with auditable diffs and traces. (≥90% tasks linked to a DAG node + MLflow trace) RPG\_TOOL\_codebase DSPY-Tutorials\_codebase

* Reduce prototype cycle time by 30% via reusable agent/RAG patterns. DSPY-Tutorials\_codebase

* Improve prompt/program quality via GEPA/optimizer tracking (≥15% task-metric lift on pilots). DSPY-Tutorials\_codebase DSPY-Tutorials\_codebase

## **Non-Goals (explicit)**

* No code-level merge of repos; conceptual integration only.

* No vendor lock-in to a single LM/tooling stack. RPG\_TOOL\_codebase

* No commitment to productionizing experimental RL paths in Phase 1. DSPY-Tutorials\_codebase

## Capabilities Inventory

-------

**RPG\_TOOL → capability → value**

* Proposal-level feature selection/exploration prompts → focused scope growth; gap closure playbooks. RPG\_TOOL\_codebase RPG\_TOOL\_codebase

* Implementation-level DAG & feature→interface mapping → clear contracts, acyclic flows, reproducibility. RPG\_TOOL\_codebase RPG\_TOOL\_codebase

* Localization/editing tool templates → narrow, auditable changes; safe import policy. RPG\_TOOL\_codebase

## **DSPY-Tutorials → capability → value**

* Agents, RAG, async/streaming/cache → faster assembly of intelligent workflows. DSPY-Tutorials\_codebase DSPY-Tutorials\_codebase

* MLflow tracing & optimizer tracking → end-to-end observability of runs/optimizations. DSPY-Tutorials\_codebase DSPY-Tutorials\_codebase

* GEPA (reflective prompt evolution) & advanced examples → measurable prompt/program gains. DSPY-Tutorials\_codebase

## Concept Design

-------

## **Target workflows**

1. **Discover/Design:** Use RPG proposal prompts to pick/expand feature paths; persist to a feature index. RPG\_TOOL\_codebase RPG\_TOOL\_codebase

2. **Specify Contracts:** Generate implementation-level DAG and per-feature interfaces (signatures/docstrings). RPG\_TOOL\_codebase RPG\_TOOL\_codebase

3. **Build/Run:** Implement as DSPy modules/agents/RAG components; run with caching/streaming as needed. DSPY-Tutorials\_codebase

4. **Observe/Optimize:** Trace with MLflow; apply GEPA/optimizer tracking; iterate prompts. DSPY-Tutorials\_codebase DSPY-Tutorials\_codebase DSPY-Tutorials\_codebase

5. **Edit Safely:** Use RPG localization/editing templates for scoped updates; re-trace. RPG\_TOOL\_codebase

## **Interfaces/contracts**

* **FeatureNode:** {id, path, role, deps\[\]} (from RPG feature tree). RPG\_TOOL\_codebase

* **InterfaceSpec:** {imports, signature, docstring, assumptions} (no impl). RPG\_TOOL\_codebase

* **RunTrace:** MLflow run id ↔ FeatureNode/InterfaceSpec mapping. DSPY-Tutorials\_codebase

## Option Analysis

-------

| Option | Description | Cost | Time | Risk | Impact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **A. Proposed** | Full concept: RPG design→DSPy build→MLflow/GEPA optimize; scoped edits via RPG tools. | Med | 4–8 wks | Med | **High** |
| **B. Minimal change** | Keep current build; adopt only MLflow tracing + a light RPG feature index for tagging. | Low | 1–2 wks | Low | Med |
| **C. Stretch** | Add experimental RL optimization + auto-code gen pilots. | High | 8–12 wks | **High** | High (uncertain) |

(Experimental RL marked high-risk/longer due to maturity notes. DSPY-Tutorials\_codebase)

## Risks & Unknowns + De-risk Plan

-------

* **Mapping overhead** between FeatureNodes and DSPy modules → _Spike_: build a vertical slice for one feature end-to-end. (1–2 days) RPG\_TOOL\_codebase

* **Tooling complexity** (MLflow, optimizers) → _Spike_: enable tracing on one agent tutorial. (0.5–1 day) DSPY-Tutorials\_codebase

* **Prompt drift** → _Spike_: run GEPA on a bounded task with target metric. (2–3 days) DSPY-Tutorials\_codebase

* **Vector index scale** → _Spike_: load 100k feature rows; measure latency. (1–2 days) RPG\_TOOL\_codebase

## Timeline & Ownership (RACI)

-------

* **Milestone 0 (Week 0–1):** Vertical slice (R: Research Eng; A: Tech Lead; C: QA, DevOps; I: PM). **Gate:** trace + metric captured.

* **Milestone 1 (Week 2–4):** Interface/DAG scaffolding + MLflow across 2 workflows (R: Eng; A: Tech Lead). **Gate:** ≥80% runs traced.

* **Milestone 2 (Week 5–8):** GEPA optimization loop + RPG editing workflow (R: Research Eng; A: Tech Lead). **Gate:** ≥10–15% lift on task metric. DSPY-Tutorials\_codebase

Metrics (with targets)

**Leading:**

* % features mapped to InterfaceSpec (→ 90%). RPG\_TOOL\_codebase

* % runs with MLflow traces + optimizer lineage (→ 90%). DSPY-Tutorials\_codebase DSPY-Tutorials\_codebase

* GEPA iteration velocity (cycles/week ≥ 3). DSPY-Tutorials\_codebase

**Lagging:**

* Prototype lead time (↓ 30% vs. baseline).

* Task quality metric (↑ ≥ 15% on pilot suites). DSPY-Tutorials\_codebase

* Defect escape rate post-edit (↓ 25% with scoped edit templates). RPG\_TOOL\_codebase

**Definition of success:** By **{deadline}**, Option A delivers two traced, optimized workflows from feature planning through execution with measurable quality gains and auditable edits.
