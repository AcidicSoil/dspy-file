**Mini-Project Plan: Graph-to-Code Pipeline Pilot**

**Alignment:** Implements background doc sections 3–5 (Planner/Implementer/Builder workflow) and 7 (Test Plan) for a constrained pilot, preserving the same topological build, validation, and metric expectations.

**Objective**

- Demonstrate end-to-end generation of a small DSPy repository using RPG-guided planning, targeting a single capability (e.g., multi-hop retrieval agent) sourced from DSPy tutorials.
- Validate graph construction, capability binding, and automated code/test generation workflows prior to scaling.

**Scope**

- Capabilities: one primary capability node (multi-hop retrieval) with supporting infrastructure nodes (retrieval tools, caching, observability).
- Artifacts: RPG_L0 → RPG_FULL JSON, generated repository skeleton, unit tests, optimizer configuration, MLflow traces.
- Exclusions: production deployment, multi-capability orchestration, advanced cost optimization.

**Workflow**

1. **Requirements Intake** (Owner: DSPy enablement)
   - Capture feature brief and constraints using stakeholder template.
2. **Capability Mapping** (Owner: RPG planner)
   - Instantiate capability nodes referencing tutorial signatures; confirm edge semantics.
   - Update vector index metadata.
3. **Graph Construction** (Owner: RPG tool team)
   - Produce L0/L1/L2 graph, validate DAG.
   - Annotate nodes with DSPy module bindings and optimizer settings.
4. **Code & Test Generation** (Owner: Applied ML squad)
   - Topologically traverse graph, generate module skeletons, unit tests, and integration harness.
   - Configure DSPy optimizers (SIMBA / BootstrapFewShot).
5. **Execution & Observability** (Owner: Applied ML squad)
   - Run optimizer compile, capture MLflow traces, verify pass rate ≥70%.
   - Collect cache metrics, streaming/async sanity checks.
6. **Review & Sign-off** (Owner: Platform engineering)
   - Evaluate metrics, update risk log, decide on scaling.

**Timeline & Milestones**

- Week 0: kickoff, finalize requirements, set up environments.
- Week 1: capability mapping + graph validation complete.
- Week 2: repository skeleton generated, initial tests passing.
- Week 3: optimizer run + tracing verified, pilot review.

**Resources & Tooling**

- RPG Tool chain (graph editor, validators, localization).
- DSPy runtime with access to `Agents`, `Multi-Hop Retrieval`, `Custom Module` assets.
- MLflow server for tracing, Faiss/pgvector for feature index.
- CI jobs for tests, lint, formatter.

**Success Metrics**

- Planning coverage ≥90% for declared capability nodes.
- Unit/integration tests pass, optimizer compilation success within two iterations.
- MLflow trace completeness ≥95% of module calls.
- Stakeholder sign-off with documented risks and follow-up actions.

**Risks & Mitigations**

- Graph-module mismatch: perform interface dry-run review before code generation.
- Optimizer cost overrun: cap iterations, enable cached runs.
- Tooling integration friction: schedule buffer for MCP or external API stubs.

**Follow-up Actions**

- If pilot succeeds, expand capability coverage, introduce deployment automation, and generalize templates across tutorials.
