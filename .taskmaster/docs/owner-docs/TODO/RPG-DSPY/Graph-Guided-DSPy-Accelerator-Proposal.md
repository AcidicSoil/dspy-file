**Concept Proposal**

**Alignment:** Anchored to "Background-Orchestrated Agent with DSPy Control + RPG" sections 0 (Scope & Summary), 2 (RPG Model), and 5–6 (Orchestration + Interfaces); expands proposal-level planning and success metrics to feed the background system’s Planner and Builder stages.

Executive summary: DSPy Tutorials deliver production-ready patterns for building, optimizing, and observing AI programs, yet teams lack a way to compose those patterns into end-to-end repositories without heavy manual orchestration. The RPG Tool operationalizes the Repository Planning Graph (RPG) method, giving us a persistent blueprint for capabilities, files, and data flows across the full software lifecycle. The RPG paper's ZeroRepo approach proves that RPG-driven planning decisively outperforms natural-language plans for long-horizon code generation. We propose "Graph-Guided DSPy Accelerator," a concept that fuses RPG planning with curated DSPy tutorial assets to generate, validate, and evolve AI-agent repositories. The accelerator will let product teams drag DSPy recipes into an RPG canvas, auto-generate implementation skeletons, and run DSPy optimizers/tests in a controlled feedback loop. This yields faster onboarding, safer iteration, and measurable coverage across complex AI workflows. The initiative targets engineering leaders who need reproducible AI systems and technical enablement teams tasked with scaling DSPy adoption under production constraints.

Problem statements & target users

- Engineering managers, DSPy platform teams, and applied ML engineers lack cohesive tooling to move from tutorial insights to production-grade repositories with rigorous planning.
- Current planning relies on verbose docs and ad hoc notebooks, leaving gaps in coverage, traceability, and regression control.
- Target users: DSPy enablement squads, ZeroRepo/RPG practitioners, production ML engineers standing up agentic or optimizer-driven services.

Unique capability map

- DSPy Tutorials: top capabilities (production-ready DSPy agent patterns, optimizer pipelines, observability/MLflow integrations) -> role: provide templatized building blocks and reference implementations bound to RPG nodes.
- RPG Tool repo: top capabilities (RPG parsing/rendering, vector-indexed feature tree, execution playbooks) -> role: serve as orchestration layer for planning, retrieval, and graph-guided execution.
- RPG research (ZeroRepo method): top capabilities (persistent capability graph, topological build/test order, graph-guided localization) -> role: enforce planning discipline, long-horizon consistency, and evaluation metrics baked into the accelerator.

Integration concept

- Modules: Capability Catalog (DSPy assets indexed into RPG), Graph Orchestrator (RPG Tool + ZeroRepo schemas), DSPy Execution Layer (optimizer & ReAct flows), Verification & Telemetry (tests, MLflow).
- Contracts: JSON-based RPG schema, DSPy module metadata (inputs/outputs, optimizer config), trace artifacts.
- Interaction flow: ingest requirements -> retrieve DSPy patterns -> instantiate RPG nodes/edges -> auto-generate skeleton repo/tests -> run DSPy optimizers -> update graph metrics.

Alternatives considered

- Status quo: manual DSPy adoption using notebooks and text specs; trade-off is slow ramp, inconsistent coverage.
- Pure ZeroRepo adoption without DSPy curation; trade-off is generic templates missing domain-validated agent patterns.
- Bespoke workflow orchestrators (e.g., LangGraph-based) without RPG; trade-off is weaker long-horizon planning and limited cross-repo reuse.

Risks, assumptions, mitigations

- Risk: Misalignment between tutorial code granularity and RPG node abstraction -> mitigation: create binding layer with metadata and sample tests per tutorial.
- Risk: Overhead of maintaining feature tree embeddings -> mitigation: automate refresh via CI jobs and Faiss/pgvector regression tests.
- Risk: Optimizer runs become cost-heavy -> mitigation: introduce budget-aware optimizer presets and simulation mode with cached traces.
- Assumptions: Access to DSPy runtime, MLflow or equivalent observability, and vector DB for retrieval.

Phased roadmap (outcomes, T-shirt size)

- Day 0: Align stakeholders, define capability ontology, ingest top 10 DSPy tutorials into feature tree (M).
- Day 30: MVP accelerator with RPG graph editor, pattern binding for ReAct + Optimizer tutorials, skeleton repo generation, smoke tests (L).
- Day 90: Production pilot with telemetry dashboards, integration tests across 3 exemplar projects, HITL review workflow, CI pipeline for graph regression (L).

Success metrics / KPIs & guardrails

- KPIs: planning coverage >=90% of declared capabilities; repository generation pass rate >=70% within two optimizer iterations; time-to-first working prototype <=1 week; tutorial reuse rate (patterns pulled per project) >=5.
- Guardrails (non-goals): no hard dependency on specific cloud providers; do not auto-commit code without HITL approval; avoid expanding into non-DSPy frameworks until core flow is stable.

Next steps

1. Confirm stakeholder objectives/audience to finalize template fields.
2. Inventory priority DSPy tutorials and annotate interfaces for RPG binding.
3. Prototype graph-to-code pipeline on a single tutorial-driven mini-project before scaling.
