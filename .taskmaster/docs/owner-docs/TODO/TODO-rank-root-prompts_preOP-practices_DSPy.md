# Additional add-ons for building with/out DSPy programs

// TODO

Output: Practical add-ons checklist | Constraints: Cite official DSPy sources; ≤10 concise bullets; no code | Acceptance criteria: Actionable list with clear ties to DSPy features and citations

Here are the last mile add-ons I’d bake in before you start:

1. Follow DSPy’s build order—**program → evaluate → optimize**—so you don’t tune a shaky pipeline. Start with a clean program, add a metric, then bring in an optimizer. ([dspy.ai][1])

2. Define a small, objective **metric** for “right prompt picked” (e.g., P@1 / nDCG@k over a labeled set, or an LLM-as-judge rubric) and wire it into DSPy’s evaluation/optimization loop. ([dspy.ai][2])

3. Use **Optimizers** to improve your re-ranker’s instructions/few-shots; start with BootstrapFewShot, graduate to **MIPROv2** when you want joint instruction+demo tuning. ([dspy.ai][3])

4. Guard outputs with **DSPy Assertions** (table shape, scores in [0,1], fallback line when no match). Assertions add reliability and automatic retries. ([dspy.ai][4])

5. Treat project analysis as **RAG**: retrieve a few representative repo snippets (README, pyproject, top files) and condition your scorer on them; this mirrors DSPy’s RAG tutorial pattern. ([dspy.ai][5])

6. Compose small **Signatures/Modules**—ProjectContext → PromptSynopsis → ReRank—rather than one mega prompt; this is the idiomatic DSPy way to scale. ([dspy.ai][6])

7. Turn on **MLflow tracing** for observability (which prompts/chunks were used, trial scores, etc.) via the DSPy–MLflow integration. ([dspy.ai][7])

8. Mind **caching & determinism** during dev: DSPy caches LM calls; use a unique rollout id when you need fresh outputs while still caching the new result. ([dspy.ai][8])

9. Keep docs handy and current: prefer the **official site** and **API reference**; snapshot sections you ingest for your local RAG corpus. ([dspy.ai][9])

10. For questions or edge cases, skim the **GitHub repo** (issues/PRs often explain behavior earlier than tutorials). ([GitHub][10])

If you want, I can map each checklist item onto your planned CLI/TUI commands next.

## User-query

what's the best way to feed the dspy docs into context while building this out ?

---

// TODO

Output: Practical plan | Constraints: Use official DSPy sources; concise; no code | Acceptance criteria: A single, actionable approach that explains how to keep DSPy docs in-context during development, with citations

Here’s a clean way to keep the DSPy docs “in the model’s head” while you build:

1. Build a tiny local RAG corpus of the DSPy docs

    * Pull the official docs pages you actually reference (Optimizers, Assertions, Tutorials, Cheatsheet). Chunk by heading (≈300–800 tokens, small overlap) and store metadata (title, URL, section). This mirrors the doc-driven RAG pattern DSPy showcases for retrieval-first workflows. [dspy.ai+1](https://dspy.ai/tutorials/rag/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

2. Use a 2-stage retriever → re-ranker for every LM call that “needs docs”

    * Stage 1: lexical/embedding shortlist from your local corpus.

    * Stage 2: a small DSPy module re-ranks top-k with your _current_ query (“what does BootstrapFewShot expect?”, “how to define a metric?”). DSPy recommends composing modules and then optimizing them; this pattern is standard in their RAG material. [dspy.ai+1](https://dspy.ai/learn/optimization/optimizers/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

3. Enforce shape + safety with **DSPy Assertions**

    * Wrap the “doc synopsis” and “final answer” steps in Assertions (e.g., require cited bullet points, max token caps). Assertions are designed to make outputs reliable and to backtrack/retry on failures. [dspy.ai+1](https://dspy.ai/learn/programming/7-assertions/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

4. Wire an explicit **metric** for doc-usefulness

    * Example: “% of answers that include ≥2 doc snippets with URLs” or a simple nDCG@k over expected sections. DSPy’s optimization loop depends on a concrete metric; define it early so you can tune your program later. [dspy.ai+1](https://dspy.ai/learn/evaluation/metrics/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

5. Optimize your “doc re-ranker” with a DSPy **Optimizer**

    * Start with **BootstrapFewShot** to learn good few-shot synopses; upgrade to **MIPROv2** if you want joint instruction + demo tuning. Treat your “include-the-right-docs” score as the optimization objective. [dspy.ai+1](https://dspy.ai/api/optimizers/BootstrapFewShot/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

6. Turn on DSPy’s MLflow tracing while you iterate

    * You’ll see which doc chunks were retrieved, how the optimizer changed prompts, and which trials scored best. This is baked into the RAG/optimizer tutorials. [dspy.ai+1](https://dspy.ai/tutorials/rag/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

7. Keep sources authoritative and current

    * Prefer the official site and GitHub repo for DSPy over blogs; snapshot versions of key pages you index (URL + date) to avoid drift. Core entry points: dspy.ai home, Tutorials, Cheatsheet, Optimizers. [dspy.ai+3dspy.ai+3dspy.ai+3](https://dspy.ai/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

If you follow this, your CLI/TUI can add a simple flag like “use DSPy docs,” and every relevant step (designing Signatures, picking an Optimizer, writing a Metric) will automatically pull the top snippets from the local DSPy corpus—reliable, fast, and auditable.
