# Overview

Product: Conversational DSPy Agent

Problem: Teams need a modular agent that adapts to evolving user goals, selects tools safely, remembers context, and produces consistent, low-variance outputs without hidden global state.

Value: Faster task success with deterministic routing, verifiable tool use, and persistent memory. Works from CLI and a minimal web endpoint. Tracks accuracy, latency, cost, and safety events.

Scope: Core agent loop with intent classification, state summarization, routing, tool selection and execution, answer generation, memory, retrieval over a knowledge base, model provider configuration, CLI, web endpoint, evaluation harness, and metrics.

Constraints: Pure Python. Typed. Small functions and clear interfaces. No global state. Streaming optional behind a flag. Environment variables for secrets only. Tool selection must use JSON schemas and dry-run checks. Least-privilege tool configs with audit logs.

# Core Features

1) Intent Classification

- What: Map each user turn + context to an intent label with confidence.
- Why: Route to the correct submodule to reduce errors and latency.
- High-level How: DSPy Signature for classification. Feature inputs include turn text, recent summary, and tool readiness flags.
- BDD:
  Given a user turn that requests code help
  When the classifier processes the turn and context
  Then it outputs intent="coding_help" with confidence ≥ threshold

2) State Summarization

- What: Compress dialogue and decisions into a bounded rolling summary.
- Why: Keep context windows small and stable.
- High-level How: DSPy module maintains a token-capped summary updated at checkpoints.
- BDD:
  Given a conversation with five prior turns
  When the summarizer runs
  Then the summary length ≤ cap and includes last decision and tool outcomes

3) Router Policy

- What: Score candidate paths {QA, task, summarization, coding help, clarify}.
- Why: Deterministic, auditable routing.
- High-level How: Score features (intent confidence, recency, tool readiness, safety risk, cost). Tie-break: safer → cheaper → faster.
- BDD:
  Given two routes with equal scores
  When tie-break rules apply
  Then the safer route is selected and logged with rationale

4) Tool Selection and Execution

- What: Pick tools from a registry, validate args, execute, capture results and errors.
- Why: Safe, schema-validated side effects with retries.
- High-level How: Precheck and dry-run spec. JSON-schema validation. Retry on transient errors. Least-privilege configs.
- BDD:
  Given a tool with a JSON schema
  When proposed arguments fail validation
  Then execution is blocked and a corrective prompt is produced

5) Answer Generation

- What: Produce the final reply and a compact rationale trace.
- Why: Clear outputs with minimal variance.
- High-level How: DSPy Signature uses retrieved context, tool outputs, and safety notes. Optional streaming.
- BDD:
  Given tool results and safety redactions
  When generating the answer
  Then the reply cites decisions and excludes redacted content

6) Memory Store (Short- and Long-term)

- What: Short-term turn buffer + rolling summary; long-term profile, preferences, tool outcomes, decisions.
- Why: Personalization and continuity across sessions.
- High-level How: Context object interface with TTL and size caps. Pluggable backends.
- BDD:
  Given a returning session with stored preferences
  When the agent starts a new turn
  Then the preferences are loaded and applied within TTL

7) Safety and Guardrails

- What: Refusal, redaction, policy notes before tool runs and before output.
- Why: Prevent unsafe actions and data leakage.
- High-level How: Pre- and post-check interceptors with policy rules. Audit events.
- BDD:
  Given a request that violates a safety rule
  When the pre-check runs
  Then the agent refuses with a concise reason and logs the refusal

8) Retrieval Layer over a Knowledge Base

- What: Retrieve relevant context from {knowledge_base}.
- Why: Ground answers and tool plans in domain data.
- High-level How: Adapter with query API and ranking. Stub or pluggable store.
- BDD:
  Given a query that matches stored documents
  When retrieval runs
  Then top-k items are returned and attached to the turn context

9) Model Provider Configuration

- What: Select LM endpoints and settings from {models}.
- Why: Control cost, latency, and quality.
- High-level How: Config file with model choices, thresholds, and streaming flag.
- BDD:
  Given multiple configured models
  When a task requires lower latency
  Then the router chooses the low-latency model per policy

10) Interfaces: CLI and Minimal Web Endpoint

- What: Operate via CLI and a single-session HTTP API.
- Why: Simple local runs and lightweight integration.
- High-level How: CLI flags for model, streaming, memory path, tool whitelist, logging. Web endpoint for single or multi-turn sessions.
- BDD:
  Given a valid CLI invocation with a tool whitelist
  When a run starts
  Then only whitelisted tools are available to the router

11) Evaluation and Metrics

- What: Unit tests, golden conversations, and metrics logging.
- Why: Track quality, stability, and regressions.
- High-level How: Test harness covers routing, memory, and tool I/O. Golden sets with success targets. Metrics: route accuracy, tool success rate, latency, token cost, safety events.
- BDD:
  Given a golden conversation suite
  When the evaluation harness runs
  Then ≥ target_success_rate% task success is reported with per-metric breakdown

# User Experience

Personas

- LLM Engineer: Builds agents and tools. Needs deterministic routing and hooks.
- Evaluation/Ops Analyst: Runs golden sets. Needs metrics and reproducibility.
- Product Integrator: Embeds the agent via HTTP. Needs simple schema and stability.
- Security/Compliance Reviewer: Audits logs and guardrails.

Key Flows

- Start session → classify → summarize → route → select tools → act → answer → persist → log.
- Correction path: user changes goal mid-conversation → reclassify → route switch with rationale.
- Tool failure path: schema fail or transient error → retry or degrade to clarify.
- Memory path: recall preferences and decisions across sessions within TTL.

UI/UX

- CLI: terse flags, clear stdout/stderr separation, exit codes for CI.
- Web: single endpoint with JSON schema for turns. Returns reply, route, confidence, and logs.
- Accessibility: readable text output, structured JSON fields, no color reliance in CLI.

# Technical Architecture

Components

- Intent Classifier, State Summarizer, Router, Tool Selector/Executor, Answer Generator, Safety Interceptors, Memory Store, Retrieval Adapter, Model Provider, CLI, Web API, Eval Harness, Metrics Logger, Audit Log.

Data Models

- Turn(id, text, timestamp, session_id)
- Summary(text, tokens, last_decision, last_tools)
- RouteDecision(route, scores, rationale)
- ToolSpec(name, schema, permissions)
- ToolCall(tool, args, result, error, retries)
- MemoryShort(buffer, summary)
- MemoryLong(profile, preferences, decisions, ttl)
- RetrievalDoc(id, title, snippet, score)
- Metrics(run_id, route_accuracy, tool_success, latency_ms, token_cost, safety_events)

APIs/Integrations

- Tools: JSON-schema contracts with precheck and dry-run.
- Retrieval: query(top_k) over {knowledge_base}.
- Models: provider selected from {models} with configurable parameters.
- I/O: CLI flags; HTTP POST /session for single and multi-turn runs.

Infrastructure

- Pure Python package. Optional HTTP server. Local file-based stores by default. Environment variables for secrets. Audit logs and metrics sinks are pluggable.

Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

- Deterministic ordering of steps and logs.
- Low variance outputs for identical inputs.
- Route accuracy ≥ configured threshold on golden sets.
- P95 end-to-end latency within target budget.
- Tool execution isolation and least privilege.
- Observability: logs and metrics for every run.
- Resilience: retries on transient tool/model errors.

Cross-Platform Strategy

- Platforms: macOS, Linux, Windows for CLI; any platform for HTTP client.
- Platform features: file paths, process signals, terminals.
- Fallbacks: if streaming unsupported → degrade to non-streaming; if a tool is unavailable on OS → skip with explain; if model endpoint unreachable → switch to backup model; if terminal lacks tty → write logs to files.
- BDD tests for fallbacks:
  Given streaming flag enabled on a model without streaming
  When a reply is generated
  Then output is produced non-streamed and a note is logged

  Given a tool marked unsupported on Windows
  When running on Windows
  Then the router excludes the tool and explains the limitation

  Given the primary model endpoint is unreachable
  When a request is issued
  Then the backup model is selected and the run proceeds within policy

Security and Privacy

- Sensitive data: user turns, retrieved docs, tool outputs, preferences. Redact in logs as configured.
- Guard policies applied pre- and post-output.
- Least-privilege tool configuration. Audit trails for tool calls and refusals.
- Secrets only via environment variables.
