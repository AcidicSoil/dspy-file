# Overview

Product: DSPy Repo Specialist

Problem: Teams need fast, deterministic understanding of unfamiliar or evolving software repositories without running builds or crawling the internet. Current ad‑hoc reviews are slow, inconsistent, and costly.

Users and value: Platform engineers, code owners, tech leads, ML/DevEx teams, and partner integrators get a repeatable brief and validated JSON to support audits, onboarding, planning, and automation.

Scope: Analyze a single repository at a specific commit and produce a structured human brief and machine JSON with tracked metrics. Operates via CLI or HTTP service. No full static analysis or compilation. No external web crawl beyond the supplied repo.

Constraints: Deterministic ordering, strict token and size budgets, least‑privilege auth, no vendor lock to a single LLM backend, bounded I/O, safe logging with redaction, and clear failure modes.

# Core Features

1) Repo Ingestion

- What: Clone or read local repo at a specific commit. Enumerate file tree, README, and package metadata. Enforce size caps and deterministic ordering.
- Why: Establish a reproducible, bounded corpus for downstream steps.
- High‑level How: Authenticated shallow clone or local path read; normalize paths; collect metadata; cap size by file count/bytes; record manifest.
- BDD:
  Given a repository URL and commit with valid auth
  When ingestion runs
  Then the repo is cloned or read at that commit, a manifest is produced with deterministic ordering, and size caps are enforced with a clear error if exceeded.

2) Target Selection

- What: Choose analysis targets using strategies (ByGlob, ByRecentGitChanges, ByHeuristic, ExplicitList) and output an ordered path list.
- Why: Control cost and focus on relevant files.
- High‑level How: Apply strategy pipeline, filter by suffixes, log final targets.
- BDD:
  Given configured selection strategy and arguments
  When selection executes
  Then an ordered, deduplicated list of target files is produced and logged.

3) Retrieval and Context Windowing

- What: Parse, chunk, rank, and assemble top‑K snippets per task within token limits with content‑hash dedup.
- Why: Fit the most relevant content into constrained context windows.
- High‑level How: Language‑aware chunkers, suffix filters, heuristic rankers, token‑budget allocator, hash‑based dedup.
- BDD:
  Given target files that exceed the token budget
  When retrieval builds contexts
  Then only top‑ranked snippets up to the budget are included and duplicates by content hash are excluded.

4) DSPy Program Orchestration

- What: Run teleprompted DSPy modules (AnalyzeRepository, AnalyzeCodeStructure, GenerateUsageExamples) with optional model routing by field type/difficulty.
- Why: Produce structured, low‑variance outputs across domains.
- High‑level How: DSPy pipeline with deterministic seeds, per‑field prompts, and routing policy.
- BDD:
  Given modules and routing policy
  When orchestration runs
  Then each module returns typed fields and the run uses deterministic seeds for repeatability.

5) Verifier and Selective Repair

- What: Validate schema, types, URLs, and non‑empty lists; regenerate only failed fields.
- Why: Reduce variance and re‑compute cost while ensuring validity.
- High‑level How: Field validators + repair loop with max retries; fail fast on unrecoverable violations.
- BDD:
  Given module outputs with a failed field
  When verification runs
  Then only that field is regenerated within retry limits and the final payload passes validation or fails cleanly.

6) Rendering

- What: Emit a human‑readable Markdown brief and a machine‑readable JSON with deterministic section order.
- Why: Serve both decision makers and downstream automation.
- High‑level How: Template renderer for Markdown and JSON schema export.
- BDD:
  Given validated outputs
  When rendering executes
  Then Markdown and JSON files are produced with deterministic ordering and stored as artifacts.

7) Evaluation and Tracking

- What: Record per‑field metrics, latency, token/cost accounting, runs, and artifacts for comparison.
- Why: Enable regression checks and cost/latency governance.
- High‑level How: Metrics collectors and run store keyed by repo+commit+config.
- BDD:
  Given a completed run
  When tracking finalizes
  Then metrics and artifacts are persisted and can be compared across runs.

8) Caching and Cost Control

- What: Read‑through cache keyed by repo and commit with TTL/eviction and budget caps per phase.
- Why: Reduce repeated cost and latency; bound spend.
- High‑level How: Content‑addressed cache; per‑phase budgets; cache hits logged.
- BDD:
  Given an identical repo+commit+config as a previous successful run
  When the pipeline executes
  Then cache hits occur for eligible phases and total cost decreases relative to a cold run.

9) Serving via CLI and HTTP

- What: Provide a CLI for local runs and an HTTP endpoint for automation with rate limits and observability.
- Why: Support both developer workflows and service integrations.
- High‑level How: CLI entrypoint; HTTP service with REST endpoints; request limits; structured logging.
- BDD:
  Given a valid request via CLI or HTTP
  When a run is triggered
  Then the system returns artifacts or a clear error with an id for correlation.

10) Security and Privacy

- What: Least‑privilege tokens, secrets isolation, bounded I/O, and safe logging with redaction.
- Why: Protect source code and credentials.
- High‑level How: Scoped tokens, secret store integration, allow‑listed paths, log scrubbers.
- BDD:
  Given a run that includes secrets or sensitive code
  When logs are produced
  Then secrets are redacted and only allowed paths are accessed.

11) Operations and Observability

- What: Health/readiness probes, structured logs with correlation IDs, usage dashboards for latency and cost.
- Why: Stable operations and quick incident response.
- High‑level How: Probe endpoints, log schema, metrics export.
- BDD:
  Given the service is running
  When probes are called
  Then readiness/liveness return pass and key metrics are exposed.

# User Experience

Personas

- Platform Engineer: sets policies, integrates into CI, monitors cost/latency.
- Repository Maintainer: runs ad hoc analysis to produce briefs for reviewers.
- Tech Lead/Architect: scans structure and risks before design decisions.
- DevEx/ML Engineer: consumes JSON for automation or dashboards.

Key flows

- CLI flow: configure repo+commit+strategy → run → view Markdown+JSON → inspect metrics and cache hits.
- HTTP flow: POST run request → poll or callback → fetch artifacts → view metrics.

UI/UX

- CLI: clear flags, deterministic output paths, colored status, correlation id display.
- HTTP: simple REST, JSON errors with codes and actionable messages.
- Accessibility: color‑blind‑safe CLI output, machine‑readable JSON, consistent ARIA labels if a web UI is later added.

# Technical Architecture

Components

- Ingestion service, Target selector, Retrieval pipeline, DSPy orchestrator, Verifier/repair, Renderer, Metrics/Run store, Cache, Auth manager, CLI, HTTP API, Observability.

Data models

- Run(id, repo, commit, config, status, timings, cost).
- TargetFile(path, size, hashes, language, selected_by).
- Snippet(id, source_path, offsets, text_hash).
- ModuleOutput(module, fields, validation_status).
- Metrics(tokens_in, tokens_out, latency_ms, cache_hits, budget_utilization).
- Artifact(type, uri, content_hash).

APIs/Integrations

- Git host access (tokened), local filesystem.
- LLM providers via abstract interface (no vendor lock).
- Secret store for tokens.
- Metrics sink and log collector.

Infrastructure

- Containerized service; ephemeral workspace; persistent artifact/metrics store; rate limiter; health/readiness probes; bounded concurrency.

Non‑functional requirements (NFRs)

- Determinism: identical inputs yield identical outputs.
- Latency: single‑repo cold run completes within a defined budget.
- Cost: per‑phase budget caps enforced.
- Reliability: clear, typed errors; retries where safe.
- Scalability: concurrent runs without cross‑talk.
- Observability: metrics, logs, correlation ids.
- Portability: CLI and HTTP work across common developer environments.

Cross‑platform strategy

- Platform features: CLI support on Linux/macOS/Windows; HTTP service with standard REST; container images for uniform runtime.
- Cross‑platform fallbacks: if native git/auth tools are unavailable, use a containerized execution path; if HTTP is unreachable, instruct use of CLI with identical config schema.
- BDD for fallbacks:
  Given a host missing required git tooling
  When a run is requested
  Then the system executes in a container and produces the same artifacts.

  Given HTTP service downtime
  When a user runs the CLI with the same config
  Then the run completes with equivalent outputs and metrics captured locally and syncs when service returns.

Security/Privacy

- Sensitive data: repository code, auth tokens, and derived snippets.
- Controls: least‑privilege scopes, secret isolation, allow‑listed I/O, log redaction, TTL on workspaces, artifact access control.
