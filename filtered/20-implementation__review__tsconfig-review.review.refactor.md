# TypeScript Configuration Review

## Summary
Review tsconfig for correctness and DX.

## Recommendations

### 1. Module and Target
- **Rationale**: Ensures compatibility with runtime environments and modern JavaScript features.
- **Evidence**: Based on project requirements and Node.js version support.

### 2. Strictness Settings
- **Rationale**: Enforces type safety and reduces potential runtime errors.
- **Evidence**: Configuration includes `strict: true` or equivalent settings.

### 3. Path Mapping
- **Rationale**: Improves code organization and maintainability by enabling aliasing.
- **Evidence**: Includes `paths` configuration in `tsconfig.json`.

### 4. Incremental Builds
- **Rationale**: Speeds up compilation during development by reusing previous outputs.
- **Evidence**: Uses `incremental: true` or `composite: true`.

## Next Steps

1. Validate that all recommended settings are applied correctly.
2. Ensure paths and module resolution align with project structure.
3. Test incremental builds for performance improvements.

## Evidence

- Configuration file inspected: `tsconfig.json`
- Settings reviewed include:
  - `compilerOptions.module`
  - `compilerOptions.target`
  - `compilerOptions.strict`
  - `compilerOptions.paths`
  - `compilerOptions.incremental`
```
