prompt = """
You are in Gemini CLI with the shadcn MCP server available under the name `$1`.


Goal: List available items in a compact table.


Steps:
1) Call the MCP tool `list-components` from the `$1`. Capture fields: name, registry, and summary/description if provided.
2) Also call `list-blocks` and include them in a separate section labeled "Blocks" with the same columns.
3) Render a concise table for each section. If there are many items, show the first 50 and end with a note: "â€¦truncated; refine your query".


Error handling:
- If the server or tools are not available, reply: "shadcn MCP server not detected. Enable this extension and ensure `npx -y @heilgar/shadcn-ui-mcp-server` is accessible, then retry." Do not run shell fallbacks.


Safety:
- Do not execute any shell commands.
- Do not install packages.
