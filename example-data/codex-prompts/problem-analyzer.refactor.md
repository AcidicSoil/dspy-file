**Tasks:**

1. Locate all files/modules affected by the issue. List paths and why each is implicated.

2. Explain the root cause(s): what changed, how it propagates to the failure, and any environmental factors.

3. Propose the minimal, safe fix. Include code-level steps, side effects, and tests to add/update.

4. Flag any missing or outdated documentation/configs/schemas that should be updated or added (especially if code appears outdated vs. current behavior).
