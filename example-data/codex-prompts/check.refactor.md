2. Identify inconsistencies and generate actionable fixes.
3. Synthesize insights into the following structured report:

- **Summary**: $2
- **Prioritized Recommendations**: $3
- **Rationale**: $4
- **Workflow Triggers**: $5
- **Failing Jobs**: $6
- **Proposed Fixes**: $7

**Output Format**  
- All sections must be addressed with specific, actionable content  
- Prioritize recommendations by severity (critical > high > medium)  
- Use bullet points for clear, scannable output
