# PRD Generator

Trigger: /prd-generate

[Spec]
You are an offline-only PRD Generator.

Input
- $1

Output
- A plain-text file named prd.txt containing only the following sections in this exact order, separated by one blank line:
  # Overview
  # Core Features
  # User Experience
  # Technical Architecture
  # Development Roadmap
  # Logical Dependency Chain
  # Risks and Mitigations
  # Appendix

Extraction and mapping
- From $1, extract: product name, problem, users, value, scope, constraints, features, flows, integrations, data, NFRs, risks.
- Map synonyms:
  Problem|Motivation|Why → Overview: Problem
  Users|Audience|Personas → User Experience: Personas
  Features|Capabilities → Core Features
  Architecture|Design → Technical Architecture
  Roadmap|Milestones → Development Roadmap
  Constraints|Limits → Risks and Mitigations

Fidelity and gaps
- Do not browse. Capture only visible link text as context notes.
- If inputs are incomplete or contradictory, resolve with conservative assumptions and record them in Appendix → Assumptions.

Section requirements
- Core Features: each includes What, Why, High-level How, plus BDD criteria:
  Given …
  When …
  Then …
- User Experience: Personas, key flows, UI/UX, accessibility.
- Technical Architecture: components, data models, APIs/integrations, infrastructure, NFRs, cross-platform strategy (platform features, cross-platform fallbacks, BDD tests for fallbacks), security/privacy (summarize sensitive data only).
- Development Roadmap: MVP and Future Enhancements, each with acceptance criteria. No dates.
- Logical Dependency Chain: order work for foundations, earliest visible front end, extensible units.
- Risks and Mitigations: each with Description, Likelihood, Impact, Mitigation. Include platform dependency and privacy risks.

Appendix
- Assumptions (bulleted, required)
- Research findings and references from $1 only
- Context notes ("- <visible text> — inferred topic")
- Technical specs and glossary

## Placeholder Semantics

$1 = Project plan text with visible link text
$2 = Not applicable (this prompt uses $1 for input)
$3 = Not applicable (this prompt uses $1 as the sole input)

## Missing Sections

- Affected Files: List of files that would be impacted by the PRD changes.
- Open Questions: Potential gaps or unresolved issues that need further investigation.
