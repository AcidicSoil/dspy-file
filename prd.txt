# Overview
This project adds LM-Studio as a selectable local model provider inside the DSPy workflow so users can run inference without relying on cloud endpoints, supporting offline experimentation and privacy-sensitive deployments.

# Core Features
- Feature: Provider Configuration UI
  What: Present LM-Studio alongside existing providers with form inputs for endpoint, model selection, and authentication flags.
  Why: Users need a streamlined way to enable LM-Studio without editing config files manually.
  High-level How: Extend the provider settings view, reuse validation helpers, and persist preferences in the existing configuration store.
  Given the user opens the provider settings page
  When they choose LM-Studio and enter a reachable local endpoint
  Then the system validates the connection and saves the provider profile
- Feature: Connection Health Checks
  What: Automatically verify LM-Studio availability and surface connection status within the UI and CLI.
  Why: Users require feedback to troubleshoot local deployments quickly.
  High-level How: Implement a lightweight ping endpoint call with meaningful error handling and retries.
  Given LM-Studio health checks are enabled
  When the system performs the periodic status ping
  Then it reports success or actionable failure details to the user
- Feature: Provider Routing Layer
  What: Allow DSPy tasks to route requests to LM-Studio based on scenario-specific policies.
  Why: Teams must balance local inference with other providers while preserving deterministic behavior.
  High-level How: Introduce a provider selector abstraction that chooses LM-Studio when rules match and falls back gracefully otherwise.
  Given a task requires a locally runnable model
  When the routing layer evaluates provider policies
  Then it dispatches requests to LM-Studio and logs usage for observability

# User Experience
Primary personas include ML engineers configuring workflows, product engineers prototyping features, and data scientists running reproducible experiments. Key flows cover enabling LM-Studio, testing connectivity, setting routing preferences, and monitoring usage diagnostics. UI/UX should reuse existing provider layout with clear form grouping, inline validation, and callouts for local deployment tips. Accessibility requires keyboard navigation, descriptive labels, status announcements, and high-contrast indications for health states.

# Technical Architecture
Components: provider configuration UI, validation services, health check scheduler, routing abstraction, logging hooks. Data models: ProviderProfile (name, endpoint, auth), HealthStatus (state, lastChecked, message), RoutingPolicy (conditions, priority). APIs/integrations: LM-Studio HTTP endpoints for model listing and inference, existing DSPy provider interfaces, optional observability sink. Infrastructure: assumes LM-Studio running on user-managed host, configuration persisted locally, background jobs executed within DSPy runtime. Non-functional requirements include low-latency routing decisions (<10 ms overhead), secure handling of local endpoints, resiliency to provider downtime, and comprehensive logging for diagnostics.

# Development Roadmap
MVP: deliver provider configuration UI, persistence, and manual connectivity test with acceptance criteria that users can enable LM-Studio, store settings, and execute a sample inference successfully. Future Enhancements: add automated health checks, routing rules editor, observability dashboards, and CLI parity with acceptance criteria that these capabilities operate across OS platforms and support multiple concurrent providers.

# Logical Dependency Chain
Finalize provider interface contracts, extend persistence layer for LM-Studio fields, implement configuration UI, add connectivity validation utilities, integrate routing layer logic, and conclude with automated health monitoring and telemetry outputs to support extensibility.

# Risks and Mitigations
- Description: LM-Studio API changes break compatibility; Likelihood: Medium; Impact: High; Mitigation: version pinning, schema validation, and compatibility tests per release.
- Description: Local environment firewalls block health checks; Likelihood: Medium; Impact: Medium; Mitigation: provide diagnostic messaging and documented port requirements.
- Description: Routing abstraction introduces latency regression; Likelihood: Low; Impact: High; Mitigation: benchmark critical paths and add caching for provider selection results.

# Appendix
Assumptions:
- Users already run DSPy locally and can install LM-Studio.
- Teams accept local network exposure of LM-Studio endpoints behind internal security controls.

Research findings:
- adding LM-Studio as provider option for users, to fulfill the plan 100% what docs are missing now. do you need more information from dspy docs or lm-studio docs so you can solve this task 100% correct? just tell me

Context notes:
- project plan text — visible link text
- product name — LM-Studio Provider Integration
- problem statement — enable offline DSPy inference with LM-Studio
- key constraints — maintain parity with existing provider UX and routing latency budgets

Technical specs:
- ProviderProfile schema: { id, type, endpoint, authToken?, models[], enabled }
- Health check endpoint: GET /v1/models (timeout 2s, retries 2)
- Routing policy evaluation: priority list with condition predicates, cached per session
- Telemetry: structured logs with provider, duration, status, errorCode fields
